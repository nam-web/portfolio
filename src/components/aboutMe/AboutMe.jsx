      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello, this is Namrata Srivastava, a MERN stack developer. I have completed my graduation in the year <span>2022</span> from <span>Madan Mohan Malaviya University Of Technology </span>
         in Electrical Engineering. I got campus placement in <span>TCS </span>along with that I also cracked off campus placement 
        in <span>Decimal Technologies</span> and <span>Global Logic</span>. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
        I have done more than 200 problems on leetcode and gfg using C++ and Java programing languages. Talking about my coding and development journey,
        I have self-learned various skills such as <span>HTML, CSS, JS, React, Git</span> by making projects. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I have great enthusiasm for learning and exploring. I strongly believe that learning is easy but having the attitude of putting 200% of 
        the efforts and seeking perfection is something hard to find. This is one of the things that makes me different from others. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Apart from my technical skills, I have <span>great communication</span> and <span>leadership skills</span> which makes me a good fit for the industry. I have
        organised various technical and non technical events in my college with more than 200 participation. I am honest to my work and priorities.
        My like writing poems and cooking tasty dishes.
